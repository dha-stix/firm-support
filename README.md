# Customer support application with Next.js,  Appwrite Cloud, Novu, and EmailJS

### The application does the following: 
- allows customers to create support tickets,
- authenticates staff and ensures that no one other than the staff can log in to the application,
- notifies the staff when a customer creates a support ticket,
- allows both the staff and customers to settle disputes via the live-chatting feature powered by [Appwrite Cloud](https://appwrite.io), and
- sends a confirmation email to the customers when they open a ticket and also when a staff sends them a message regarding the open ticket.
